This is IT's <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source</a> software
mirror. We have gobs of software here to save you time downloading it from the
internet. If you need ftp access, try <a
href="ftp://mirror.example.com">ftp://mirror.example.com</a>.

<p>

If there is a project you would like to see mirrored, let us know at the e-mail
address at the bottom and we'll see what we can do. We can't guarantee your
favorite project will be mirrored, but if you have a reasonable request, we
will most likely be able to comply.
